# Overview
Dinnr is a single-page fullstack clone of OpenTable where users can find top rated restaurants near them and make a reservation to dine in. Each restaurant includes information on it's location, menus, photos, and attributes which users can view before commiting to making an account and booking a table. Reviews and ratings are generated by our users once a visit has been completed and each user will soon have their own profile page to manage their information, upcoming reservations, past reservations, and reviews

### Restaurant carousel
Splash page features a clickable carousel of restaurants with styled info blocks for each restaurant. 

### Search wildcards
Searches include a `date`, `time`, and `party size` however at present, `time` is the only required. An optional case insensitive wildcard can be keyed in for `location`, `cuisine`, or `restaurant name` which is handled by the restaurant model. Validations for required inputs are modular and can be added or removed to integrate with the main `search(terms)` function similar to the `withinOpenHours(rest, time)` function below

```ruby
def self.search(terms)
    results = Restaurant.where("name ILIKE :term OR city ILIKE :term OR cuisine_type ILIKE :term", term: "%#{terms[:wildcard]}%")

    if results.length > 0
        withinHours = results.select { |restaurant| Restaurant.withinOpenHours(restaurant, terms[:time]) }
        withinHours.length > 0 ? @restaurants = withinHours : @restaurants = {}
    else
        @restaurants = {}
    end
end

def self.withinOpenHours(rest, time)
    t = time.to_f
    open = rest.open_at
    close = rest.close_at

    return ((t > open) && (t < close))
end
```
